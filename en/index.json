And also don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate and feel free to share your opinion in the comments below.\nWhich is better, light theme or dark theme? Here are the results of my search on this topic.\nLight Theme  Suitable for use when the lighting is bright enough, such as in the morning, afternoon, or outdoors. Black on a white background is good for reading, because the brain is easier to accept it. Suitable for long-term reading.  Dark Theme  Suitable for use when lighting is poor, such as at night, in the evening, or in a dark room. Can save power (especially for AMOLED and OLED screens) Good in long term effects. Suitable for people with eye disorders such as cataracts.  Conclusion So, the theme that we use needs to be adjusted to the surrounding conditions and what activities we are doing. The light theme is suitable for use when the lighting is sufficient and good for reading. On the other hand, the dark theme is suitable for use when the lighting is lacking.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all I can share in this post, thank you.\nReferences  https://www.nngroup.com/articles/dark-mode/ [Recommended] https://rxoptical.com/eye-health/is-dark-mode-better-for-your-eyes/ https://www.maketecheasier.com/are-dark-themes-better-for-eyes-battery/ https://www.quora.com/Are-dark-themes-for-IDEs-and-code-editors-good-for-the-eyes?share=1  ","permalink":"https://atalazer.github.io/en/posts/light-vs-dark-theme/","summary":"Introduction In this post, I want to share my search for comparing light and dark theme.
